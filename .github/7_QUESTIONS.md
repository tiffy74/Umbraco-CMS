# Questions

You can get in touch with [the PR team](#the-pr-team) in multiple ways, we love open conversations and we are a friendly bunch. No question you have is stupid. Any questions you have usually helps out multiple people with the same question. Ask away:

- If there's an existing issue on the issue tracker then that's a good place to leave questions and discuss how to start or move forward
- Unsure where to start? Did something not work as expected? Try leaving a note in the ["Contributing to Umbraco"](https://our.umbraco.org/forum/contributing-to-umbraco-cms/) forum, the team monitors that one closely
- We're also [active in the Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)
