# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [Sebastiaan Janssen - sj@umbraco.dk](mailto:sj@umbraco.dk).

## Code Of Conduct
 
Our informal code of conduct concentrates on the values we, as Umbraco HQ, have set for ourselves and for our community. We expect you to be a friend. 
Instead of listing out all the exact "do's" and "don't's" we want to challenge you to think about our values and apply them:

If there's a need to talk to Umbraco HQ about anything, please make sure to send a mail to [Sebastiaan Janssen - sj@umbraco.dk](mailto:sj@umbraco.dk).

## Be a Friend

We welcome and thank you for registering at Our Umbraco. Find below the values that govern Umbraco and which you accept by using Our Umbraco.

## Trust

Assume positive intent and try to understand before being understood.

## Respect

Treat others as you would like to be treated.

This also goes for treating the HQ with respect. For example: don’t promote products on [our.umbraco.org](https://our.umbraco.org) that directly compete with our commercial offerings which enables us to work for a sustainable Umbraco.

## Open

Be honest and straightforward. Tell it as it is. Share thoughts and knowledge and engage in collaboration.

## Hungry

Don't rest on your laurels and never accept the status quo. Contribute and give back to fellow Umbracians.

## Friendly

Don’t judge upon mistakes made but rather upon the speed and quality with which mistakes are corrected. Friendly posts and contributions generate smiles and builds long lasting relationships.
