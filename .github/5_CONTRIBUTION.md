# Making a contribution

## What should I know before I get started?

### Working with the source code

Some parts of our source code is over 10 years old now. And when we say "old", we mean "mature" of course!

There's two big areas that you should know about:

  1. The Umbraco backoffice is a extensible AngularJS app and requires you to run a `gulp dev` command while you're working with it, so changes are copied over to the appropriate directories and you can refresh your browser to view the results of your changes.
  You may need to run the following commands to set up gulp properly:
  ```
  npm cache clean
  npm install -g bower
  npm install -g gulp
  npm install -g gulp-cli
  npm install
  gulp build
  ```
  2. "The rest" is a C# based codebase, with some traces of our WebForms past but mostly ASP.NET MVC based these days. You can make changes, build them in Visual Studio, and hit `F5` to see the result.

To find the general areas of something you're looking to fix or improve, have a look at the following two parts of the API documentation.

  * [The AngularJS based backoffice files](https://our.umbraco.org/apidocs/ui/#/api) (to be found  in `src\Umbraco.Web.UI.Client\src`)
  * [The rest](https://our.umbraco.org/apidocs/csharp/)

### What branch should I target for my contributions?

We like to use [Gitflow as much as possible](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/), don't worry if you are not familiar with it. The most important thing you need to know is that when you fork the Umbraco repository, the default branch is set to something, usually `dev-v7`. Whatever the default is, that's where we'd like you to target your contributions.

### Building Umbraco from source code

The easiest way to get started is to run `build.bat` which will build both the backoffice (also known as "Belle") and the Umbraco core. You can then easily start debugging from Visual Studio, or if you need to debug Belle you can run `gulp dev` in `src\Umbraco.Web.UI.Client`. See [this page](BUILD.md) for more details.

Alternatively, you can open `src\umbraco.sln` in Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.3 or higher, [the community edition is free](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) for you to use to contribute to Open Source projects). In Visual Studio, find the Task Runner Explorer (in the View menu under Other Windows) and run the build task under the gulpfile.

After this build completes, you should be able to hit `F5` in Visual Studio to build and run the project. A IISExpress webserver will start and the Umbraco installer will pop up in your browser, follow the directions there to get a working Umbraco install up and running.

### Keeping your Umbraco fork in sync with the main repository

We recommend you sync with our repository before you submit your pull request. That way, you can fix any potential merge conflicts and make our lives a little bit easier.

Also, if you've submitted a pull request three weeks ago and want to work on something new, you'll want to get the latest code to build against of course.

To sync your fork with this original one, you'll have to add the upstream url, you only have to do this once:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS.git
```

Then when you want to get the changes from the main repository:

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/dev-v7
```

In this command we're syncing with the `dev-v7` branch, but you can of course choose another one if needed.

## Styleguides

To be honest, we don't like rules very much. We trust you have the best of intentions and we encourage you to create working code. If it doesn't look perfect then we'll happily help clean it up.

That said, the Umbraco development team likes to follow the hints that ReSharper gives us (no problem if you don't have this installed) and we've added a `.editorconfig` file so that Visual Studio knows what to do with whitespace, line endings, etc.
