# What to Contribute

## How do I begin?

Before making contributions to Umbraco - you must communicate to the Umbraco PR Team on the details of your contribution.

There are several ways of doing this depending on whether your contribution is addressing a bug or suggesting an enhancement.

Unsure where to begin contributing to Umbraco? You can start by looking through [these `Up for grabs` and issues](http://issues.umbraco.org/issues/U4?q=%28project%3A+%7BU4%7D+Difficulty%3A+%7BVery+Easy%7D+%23Easy+%23Unresolved+Priority%3A+Normal+%23Major+%23Show-stopper+State%3A+-%7BIn+Progress%7D+sort+by%3A+votes+Affected+versions%3A+-6.*+Affected+versions%3A+-4.*%29+OR+%28tag%3A+%7BUp+For+Grabs%7D+%23Unresolved+%29).

The issue list is sorted by total number of upvotes. While not perfect, number of upvotes is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Umbraco CMS. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report üìù, reproduce the behavior üíª üíª, and find related reports üîé.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](http://issues.umbraco.org/issues#newissue=61-30118), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

##### Before Submitting A Bug Report

  * Most importantly, check **if you can reproduce the problem** in the [latest version of Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.org/download/). We might have already fixed your particular problem.
  * It also helps tremendously to check if the issue you're experiencing is present in **a clean install** of the Umbraco version you're currently using. Custom code can have side-effects that don't occur in a clean install.
  * **Use the Google**. Whatever you're experiencing, Google it plus "Umbraco" - usually you can get some pretty good hints from the search results, including open issues and further troubleshooting hints.
  * If you do find and existing issue has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue if you have additional information. If you have the same problem and no new info to add, just "star" the issue.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem. The following is a long description which we've boiled down into a few very simple questions in the issue tracker when you create a new issue. We're listing the following hints to indicate that the most successful reports usually have a lot of this ground covered:

  * **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
  * **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining which steps you took in the backoffice to get to a certain undesireable result, e.g. you created a document type, inherting 3 levels deep, added a certain datatype, tried to save it and you got an error.
  * **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. If you wrote some code, try to provide a code sample as specific as possible to be able to reproduce the behavior.
  * **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
  * **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

  * **Can you reproduce the problem** when `debug="false"` in your `web.config` file?
  * **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Umbraco) or was this always a problem?
  * **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

  * **Which version of Umbraco are you using?** 
  * **What is the environment you're using Umbraco in?** Is this a problem on your local machine or on a server. Tell us about your configuration: Windows version, IIS/IISExpress, database type, etc.
  * **Which packages do you have installed?**

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Umbraco, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion üìù and find related suggestions üîé.

Most of the suggestions in the [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs) section also count for suggesting enhancements.

Some additional hints that may be helpful:

  * **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Umbraco which the suggestion is related to.
  * **Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Umbraco users** and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [community package](https://our.umbraco.org/projects/).
